<br>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
You've examined and documented quite a bit of information from the iPhone image file. Now, you will use that documentation to build a final report. Before you complete your report, there is still some additional evidence to analyze. Since the internal investigators knew that Peter was close with Rosie, they collected Rosie's phone for your to analyze to determine if she in fact a co-conspirator.

<br>
<br>
Export those 2 files
<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>

<h2>Bonus - Determining the Ring Leader of the Operation</h2>
Throughout the week, there were mentions that there was a ring leader secretly behind the operations of this crime. Additionally there are rumors this person is called Mr X. Can you determine who is Mr X?
<ul>
  <li>Hint 1 - You may have to listen to this evidence on your local computer as Kali doesn't always play sound.</li>
  <li>Hint 2 - Look for this evidence you want to listen to, on Peter's phone.</li>
</ul>
